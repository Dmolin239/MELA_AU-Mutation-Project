# MELA_AU-Mutation-Project
CSCI 5465 Final Project. 
EGR1 is from the early growth response family of C2H2-type zinc-finger proteins. Zinc proteins are used in cellular activities such as transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. Additionally, EGR1 has been speculated to be a cancer suppressor protein for its associated with cell apoptosis and other cancer regulating proteins. This study utilized data from the MELA-AU project, in addition to R and python programming, to develop a logistic regression model for the occurrence of EGR1 mutations in donors given their age, sex, exposure to light, and family history of cancer. The p-values for each of the independent variables were found to be not significantly associated with the presence of EGR1 mutations in donors. Future studies should be expanded onto more genes besides EGR1 and further development of the R and python scripts to more confidently process logistic regression models.
